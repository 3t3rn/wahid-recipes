    <h1>A slice of heaven </h1>
    <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,<br> flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese,<br> and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, olives, vegetables,<br> meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-<br>fired oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F to 115째F)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, vegetables, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>Add salt, olive oil, and flour to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C).</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce over the base, sprinkle with cheese, and add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
